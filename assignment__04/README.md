A 3d cube with a wooden texture. Translation, rotation, and scale transformations are applied on the cube, their values can be changed live.


## The Debugging tool
We used a debugging tool called [**ImGui**](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) and it is discussed in this [**video**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVaQuNXueFw). The whole [**playlist**](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlrATfBNZ98foTJPJ_Ev03o2oq3-GGOS2) is really great for learning OpenGL.
